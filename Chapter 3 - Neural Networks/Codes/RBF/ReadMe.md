# Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). The RBFNN is a type of artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions.

## Overview

The RBF class in this repository provides functionalities to create and train an RBFNN model. It includes methods to fit the model, predict outputs, visualize training progress (loss and accuracy), and more.

### Usage

To use the RBFNN model:

1. **Instantiate the RBF model**:
   ```python
   Model = RBF('My First RBF')
