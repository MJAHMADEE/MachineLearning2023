# Decision Trees ðŸŒµ

This repository contains implementations and examples of Decision Tree algorithms.

## ðŸ”¸ ID3 (from Scratch)

This section presents the manual implementation of ID3 algorithm for Decision Trees, including:

- **Entropy Calculation:** A function to compute entropy based on label values.
- **Information Gain Calculation:** A method to compute information gain for attributes.
- **Decision Tree & Node:** Classes to build decision tree nodes and generate the decision tree based on the ID3 algorithm.
- **Prediction:** A function to predict outcomes based on the generated tree.
- **Visualization:** Code snippets to visualize the constructed decision tree.

## ðŸ”¸ Decision Tree (using `sklearn`)

This section demonstrates the usage of Decision Tree from the `sklearn` library, including:

- **Training with `DecisionTreeClassifier`:** Usage of the classifier for classification tasks.
- **Attributes Exploration:** Accessing various attributes of the trained decision tree model.
- **Printing Decision Tree:** Visualizing the decision tree created by `sklearn`.
- **Regression with `DecisionTreeRegressor`:** Utilizing decision trees for regression tasks.

### Examples Included:

- Classification examples using datasets like Iris.
- Regression examples using energy consumption datasets.

## Usage

The repository offers examples and implementations that can be run and tested directly. Each section contains code snippets and explanations for understanding and utilizing Decision Trees for classification and regression tasks.
